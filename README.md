WordPress Toolbar Collapse
===================================
A tiny WordPress plugin that collapses the Toolbar (previously known as Admin Bar) with pure CSS.
Once installed, hover with the mouse or tap on top of your website to view it.
The static Toolbar also works as a reminder that you’re logged-in, so don’t forget to *Log Out* on public computers.
